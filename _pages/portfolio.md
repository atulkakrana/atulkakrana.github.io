## Area Of Expertise
**ML, Deep Learning, Generative AI, & Data Science for Health, Clinical, & Life Science Research.**
* **Decision Sciences**: Predictive Modeling, Agentic-AI, Knowledge Graphs, etc.
* **Digital Biology**: Generative biology, *In Silico* Discovery, Biomolecular Modeling, etc.
* **Information Extraction**: NLP, LLMs, Explainable AI, etc.
* **Data Management Frameworks**: data products, fabric, etc.
* **Data & AIML Governance** 

The majority of research (2018-2024) is done as part of the AIML scientist role in the industry. Before 2017, the research was done in academic and as part of non-profit research institutes and is available on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=virwGJEAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)
