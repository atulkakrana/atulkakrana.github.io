**Atul Kakrana** is a Data Scientist in the Health and Life Sciences (Operations) at [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/) (Philadelphia). His work empowers the Elsevier's [Clinical Solutions](https://www.elsevier.com/clinical-solutions) and [Life Science's R&D](https://www.elsevier.com/rd-solutions/pharma-and-life-sciences-solutions) buisness. 

His previous works explored the unknown regions of genomes discovering genes that do not code proteins but function in other important ways, and the known regions of genome to identify genes that underlie human genetic diseases.   

His research identified a [new class of RNAs](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/28/9/1333.short) in the genome and shed light in their unique biogenesis pathways. His work on rare diseases guides clinical geneticists to identify genetic variations that cause human genetic diseases. 

Atul received his Ph.D. from the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at [UDel](https://www.udel.edu/). He is a recipient of the ‘Competitive Fellow Doctoral Fellowship’ and ‘Provost Distinguished Graduate Fellowship’ for his research in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology. Atul also holds a Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology and a Master’s degree in Biochemistry. His research featured in reputed public news outlets.
