I am a Computational Scientist in the Life Sciences (Operations) at [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/) (Philadelphia). My work empowers the Elsevier's [Life Science's R&D](https://www.elsevier.com/rd-solutions/pharma-and-life-sciences-solutions) and [Clinical Solutions](https://www.elsevier.com/clinical-solutions) business. 

In my Ph.D., I developed new computational methods to (a) discover new forms of small RNAs <sup>[1](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/42/18/e139/2434515?login=true), [2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/158832v1.full)</sup> and RNA genes<sup>[3](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2018/07/12/gr.228163.117)</sup> from largely unexplored regions of the genomes and (b) identify genes associated with human genetic diseases<sup>[4](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/D1/D875/4161993)</sup>. To learn more about my work, please see my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=virwGJEAAAAJ&hl=en)

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at [UDel](https://www.udel.edu/). I have received multiple awards and grants to support my research, including the 'Provost Distinguished Graduate Fellowship.' I hold a Master's degree in Biochemistry and a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology. My research is cited in reputed public news outlets, [NIH director's blog](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2018/05/17/snapshots-of-life-lens-crafting/) and high impact research journals.
