I am a Computational Scientist in the Life Sciences (Operations) at [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/) (Philadelphia). My work empowers the Elsevier's [Life Science's R&D](https://www.elsevier.com/rd-solutions/pharma-and-life-sciences-solutions) and [Clinical Solutions](https://www.elsevier.com/clinical-solutions) business. 

In my Ph.D., I developed new computational methods to (a) discover new forms of RNAs and RNA genes from largely unexplored regions of the genomes and (b) identify genes associated with human genetic diseases. To learn more about my work, please see my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=virwGJEAAAAJ&hl=en)

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at [UDel](https://www.udel.edu/). I have received multiple awards and grants to support my research, including the 'Provost Distinguished Graduate Fellowship.' I hold a Master's degree in Biochemistry and a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology. My research is cited in reputed public news outlets, [NIH director's blog](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2018/05/17/snapshots-of-life-lens-crafting/) and high impact research journals.
